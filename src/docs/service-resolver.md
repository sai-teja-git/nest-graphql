# Calling Graphql resolver from service

1. Call the GraphQL Query Internally (via HTTP Request)
2. Call the Service Method Directly (Better Approach)

## **Which Option is Better?**

| Approach                                     | When to Use                                         | Pros                                            | Cons                                        |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Option 1: HTTP Call to GraphQL API**       | When you need to call GraphQL inside a function     | Uses GraphQL query exactly as a client would    | Slight overhead from making an HTTP request |
| **Option 2: Call Service Function Directly** | When calling within the same repo and service layer | More efficient (no HTTP request), best practice | Doesn't use GraphQL directly                |

### **✅ Best Practice:**

- **If you're in the same repo** → Call the **service method directly** (`Option 2`).
- **If you must use GraphQL internally** → Use **Axios or Fetch to query your own API** (`Option 1`).
